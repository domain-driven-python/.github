# Domain Driven Python

## Aims

- collect Python implementations of Domain Driven Design patterns
- connect iterested Pythonistas via [Discord "Domain Driven Python"](https://discord.gg/2aFve6uF)
- condolidate Domain Driven Design pattern implementations
- add missing peaces in the puzzle:
  - service bus ([What's missing to make FastAPI and friends shine in advanced Domain Driven Design?](https://florian-kromer.medium.com/whats-missing-to-make-fastapi-shine-in-advanced-domain-driven-design-133ee0b205bc))
  - ...
- setup a community equivalent to [Jazzband](https://jazzband.co/) to collaboratively maintain DDD related Python packages
- provide a way for development effort sponsoring and contributor payout (with [opencollective.com](https://opencollective.com/) and [polar.sh](https://polar.sh/))
